Phantom clock for the TRS-80 Model II (and others)

This Private (for the time being) repo is used for all information regarding the Dallas DS1315 chip.
Also here are the executables for the Model II that sets and reads the clock chip.
As most TRS-80 use a 24 pin socket, that is the slot selected. Changes to support a larger chip (28 pin) can be made when needed.
